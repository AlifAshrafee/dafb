                            The human rights programme of NETZ focuses on Northern Bangladesh: Five human rights organisations mobilise active people to stand up for human rights - and we are supporting them. Through trainings, analysis, political dialogue and ideas for a peaceful conflict transformation*, we are strengthening the capabilities of volunteers and full-time professionals from the local to the national level.</p>

                        <h2>Collective strength</h2>
                        <p>7,400 people actively campaign against violence, child marriages and land grabbing. In a catchment area of 2 million people, they are strengthening human rights. Organised in groups, they enable people from socially disadvantaged groups to receive the social benefits that they are entitled to by law. Moreover, they prevent corruption as well as arbitrariness and hold politicians and state administration accountable on many levels. They also prevent violence against women and child marriages. 4,800 students from 32 high schools are being trained in theatrical techniques to visualize violence against women in order to encourage gender justice. Altogether we understand our aspirations as a commitment towards strengthening activist action in Bangladesh and fostering democratic ideals of participation and representation of interests of discriminated groups in the public sphere.</p>

                        <p>These human rights groups then again act as role models for otherâ€™s in the public striving for change. By promoting the inclusion of women, minorities and young people framed by sound planning they create successful approaches visible all across the country.</p>
